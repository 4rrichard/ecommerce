### **Motivation for the project:**

#### I wanted to learn more about firebase, make my understaning of the React states more stable and also try a new way of doing CSS so I used MaterialUI too.

</br>

### I built the application with: 
- React JS
- Firebase
- Material UI

### **What did I learn about during the project?**

- authentication(registering & signing in users through firebase)
- navigation on the website
- saving and retreiving data in localstorage
- getting more comfortable with React hooks

### **Plans in the near future**
- creating a backend server so I can implement payment with Stripe
- fixing some visual bugs & making the site responsive
